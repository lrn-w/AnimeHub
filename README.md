# AnimeHub
Anime Hub is a single page application created as a final project for a full-stack development course I took. Anime Hub GY is a store located in Guyana that specializes in anime merchandise. Currently, orders are placed via direct messages on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. The purpose of this website was to create a page to showcase Anime Hub GY and simulate customer orders. The languages used to develop this website were HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap templates, Python, Flask, & MongoDB. Future developments would be updating navigation, adding more pages, and modifying the database collection.
